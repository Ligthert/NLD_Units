- Squad and Team Leaders now have an UGL.

- Minor fixes.
- Due to the inclusion of CUP Weapons, the Apache and the NH90 as untouched PBOs I've changed the version to the release date. Updates to the dependencies shouldn't give us a headache about the version number which is now virtually meaningless.

v0.1.7
- Different weapons closer to home (kju kindly granted us permission to use the weapons in CUP. While the current implementation is somewhat odd it does offer a much needed change).
- Better armour for helmets and plate-carriers (Now we should die less often when getting hit, previous values were comparable with t-shirts and baseball caps).
- Empty backpack for Arsenal/VAS (This should prevent having the same items multiple times in your backpack).
- Other changes include respecing of the kit of several roles reflecting the adoption of CUP Weapons for the arsenal.
- Also SF forces have a unit with an MP5 for your CQB action!

v0.1.5
- Clean-up of the config.
- Zeus support (thanks to a clean-up of the config).
- AGM fast-roping support for the MH65 and the NH90.
- SF units now have a regular pistol, but a silencer in the backpack (due to AGM).
- Medics now Medic.
- Engineers now Engineer.
- Explosive Specialists now Deactivate.
- Haters now hate.

v0.1
- first release.
